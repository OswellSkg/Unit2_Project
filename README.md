# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
The campus of UWC ISAK Japan is located in a small town on a mountain, Karuizawa. The altitude is 1251m, and the humidity as well as temperature is 
lower compared to that of the sea surface ground. From SKINKRAFT LABORATORY, the low humidity and temperature causes a lot of problems such as excessive sweating, acne breakout, anhidrosis and heat rash . For that reason, Student A from UWC ISAK Japan has requested an application to be updated of local temperature and humidity, and furthermore be updated of future temperature and humidity predictions for low-cost budget. This is also going to be used to help the client decide how they dress the next day accordingly to the predicted temperature and humidity.

## Proposed Solution
Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity and temperature and a custom data script that process and anaysis the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequare precision and range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more eleborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and accuracy required in this applicaiton the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the Arduino UNO microcontroller [^3]. "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software"[^4]. In additon to the low cost of the Arduino (< 6USD), this devide is programable and expandable[^1]. Other alternatives include diffeerent versions of the original Arduino but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.

Considering the budgetary constrains of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python is open source, it is mature and supported in mutiple platforms (platform-independent) including macOS, Windows, Linux and can also be used to program the Arduino microprocessor [^5][^6]. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a High level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction [^7]. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is responsability of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory [^7], this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition a HLL language will allow me and future developers extend the solution or solve issues proptly.

**Fig.1** shows the system diagram for the proposed solution (**SL**). The indoor variables will be measured using an Arduino microprocessor and the sensor DHT11 conencted to the local computer (Laptop) located inside a room. The outdoor variables will be requested to the remote server using a GET request to the API of the server at ```192.168.6.147/readings```. The local values are stored in a CSV database locally.
